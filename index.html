<h1>What You Need to Know</h1>
<p>Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 can lower your risk of getting and spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Vaccines can also help prevent serious illness and death.
    All steps have been taken to ensure that vaccines are safe and effective for people ages 5 years and older.
    If you already had COVID-19, you should still get a COVID-19 vaccine for added protection.
    When you are up to date on COVID-19 vaccination, you can resume many activities with proper precautions (e.g., mask wearing in indoor public spaces).</p>
